# weShare
Application that allows for news to be posted like a forum from the users. 
The IDE that was used to create the project was Android Studio.

The application had run on the use of Google Firebase, storing the information regarding a users forums that have been posted and 
stored the users' information regarding username and passwords.

The application also has use of Google Maps in order to develop our mapping system and current location determination.

When the project was created, it was initially done for the Congressional App Challenge as a project. Below is the script for a description of how the app works:

When you first open our weShare app you see the login page where you can sign in with a pre-existing account. 
At the bottom of the page, you can sign up with a new account.
When you create an account, you can create your own username, set your email, password, and retype your password for confirmation. 
For this demo we will be signing in with a pre-existing account. 
Entering the app, the first thing you see is our home page, which displays the purpose of our app, connecting the community. 
In the top left, you can access our navigation drawer to navigate our app. 
Taking a look at our main forum page, you can see all the forum posts that are created by current users as well as your own. 
By tapping into the forum, you can view each of the forums meticulously. 
What is displayed are the title, forum type, the full description, as well as the location of occurrence for the forum. 
By tapping the pencil at the bottom right, you can edit the forum post, changing the title, forum type, description, and the marker. 
To remove, you can hit the trash can and to finalize your edits, you can hit the pencil. 
You can’t edit another person’s post as our app is designed to not allow you to. 
As you can see, some of the forums have usernames while other have anonymous, which is a feature our app provides, protecting the privacy of our users.  
Additionally, you can press the add button to add a forum. 
Here, you can type in a title, select a type of forum you want to be posted, and type a description. 
At the bottom of the page, there is a button that you can press to add a location to your forum. 
Then, you can press the plus button to add a marker and then the add button to add the forum. 
When you click on the map on the main page, you will be brought to a map that shows you the markers at each forum’s location within a 10-mile radius. 
By pressing this back button, you will be taken back to the main screen.
